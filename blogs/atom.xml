    <summary type="html">Preface
ICPC 2024 regional has ended, and our team ranked #20 and #38 in Jakarta and Hanoi sites, respectively. As a final year for participating in ICPC as a contestant, I felt quite disappointed and pitiful for the results. Nevertheless, I enjoy the process for training and learning with all NTU c</summary>

The Pisano period of a prime , is defined as the minimum integer satisfying , where is the Fibonacci sequence. It is well known that for , is either a divisor of or . In this article, we extend this conclusion to any C-finite sequence of the formulae , where is a constant.

    <summary type="html">Problem definition
An undirected graph is -coloring if all vertices could be colored with at most different colors, such that all adjacent vertices have different colors. For example, a -clique is -coloring, and a tree is 2-coloring. The densest subgraph of a graph , is an induced subgraph of a vert</summary>

    <summary type="html">A tree is a connected undirected graph with nodes and edges. The diameter of a tree is the largest distance between two nodes in the tree.

We define a growing tree as follows: at each moment, a new node is inserted into the tree, and is connected to some node in the original tree. What is the diame</summary>

    <summary type="html">In this article, we would use to represent the bitwise XOR operation between two integers. We observe that: for any , , and therefore, for any .

We now illustrate the formal proof of the above observation.

We firstly write into a binary format, i.e.:
